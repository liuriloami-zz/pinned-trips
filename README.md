# Pinned Trips

PinnedTrips is a travel organizer based on pinned places. Users can manage where they want to go, searching for the name of the place or pinning it on the map. Users can also manage all their saved places, marking as visited, removing or moving them to specific categories.

After a place is pinned (countries, cities, stores or anything else) users can write **lists** and **notes** about it, organizing what is need to be known about that place and listing what are the things to be done there. Users can also take photos and videos (or get them from the gallery), relating them to a specific place. In that way, users can **organize the media** taken on their trips.

When the **synchronization** is activated, everything is 8automatically synced to the cloud*. If the user is not connected in the moment, all new or changed informations are synced in the next time the device is connected to the internet. The synchronization can be done using **Dropbox** or **Google Drive** (or both). In order to use this functionality, users need to connect to their accounts using the option menu.

PinnedTrips automatically organize places using a **parenting system**. For example, if a user select Ireland, Dublin and Cork as pinned places, inserting informations about them, Dublin and Cork places will be accessed inside the Ireland one. This functionality can be disabled accessing the option menu.

Finally, users can **create and manage travel itineraries**, selecting and ordering their places. A travel itinerary can have specific notes and lists related to it, as well as the selected places on it.
